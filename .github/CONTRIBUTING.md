# Contributing Guide

## Which Branch?

All bug fixes should be sent to the latest stable branch. Bug fixes should never be sent to the develop branch unless they fix features that exist only in the upcoming release.

Minor features that are fully backwards compatible with the current release may be sent to the latest stable branch.

Major new features should always be sent to the develop branch, which contains the upcoming release.

If you are unsure if your feature qualifies as a major or minor, sent to the develop branch.
